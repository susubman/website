        <h3>
            Motivation.
        </h3>

        <div class="para">
            <p>
                This project brings together two things I care deeply about: understanding people and writing code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Before I pivoted into Computer Science, I studied Sociology — a field that taught me to think critically
                about how ideas spread and how communities form around them.
                I’ve written essays on what feminism means today, the rise of anti-vaxxers, and how modern cults use
                online
                platforms to recruit and retain followers. What stood out to me across these topics was <b>the power of
                    misinformation </b> —
                how a rumour can start small and yet influence entire networks of people, often with serious real-world
                effects.
            </p>

            <p>

                That insight led to this simulation: a way to model how rumours might spread through a network of
                individuals, with different parameters influencing who gets "infected" by the rumour and how quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
                I chose to build this in Java because it's a language I’m comfortable with, and one that’s particularly
                strong when it comes to building structured, scalable simulations.
                I also wanted to push myself beyond just scripting or visualising — I wanted to build something that
                reflected solid object-oriented thinking and made good use of classes, interfaces, and simulation loops.
            </p>

            <p>
                This was more than a coding exercise. It was a way to connect my sociological background with my growing
                skills in software development — and to explore how tech can be used to better understand the social
                challenges we face.

        <h3>
            How I Built It.
        </h3>

        <div class="para">
            <p><b>Language used: </b> Java — great for modelling object-based systems.</p>
        </div>



        <h4>
            Main Components.
        </h4>

        <ul class="list-block">
            <li><code>Main.java</code>: Entry point of the program, sets up the simulation.</li>
            <li><code>Person.java</code>: Each person has traits like whether they’ve heard or spread the rumour.</li>
            <li><code>Network.java</code>: Creates a social graph of people and hadles who is connected to whom.</li>
            <li><code>RumourSimulation.java</code>: Runs the simulation over time — deciding who hears the rumour and
                who spreads it.</li>
            <li><code>Stats.java</code>: Tracks and outputs data like how many people have heard the rumour and who
                spreads it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>
            The Logic.
        </h4>
        <ul class="list-block">
            <li>The sumulation starts with one person hearing a rumour.</li>
            <li>Each time step, people interact with their neighbours.</li>
            <li>Depedning on the probability (e.g., how gullible or cautious they are), people decide whether to beleive
                or share the rumour</li>
            <li>A proportion of people are <b>fact-checkers</b> — they independently verify that they hear. If they
                fact-check a rumour, they become immune to it and stop spreading it.</li>
            <li>The rumour keeps spreading until it fizzles out or everyone has heard it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            What I Learned.
        </h3>

        <ul class="list-block">
            <li>How to design and implement a simulation from scratch using object-orientated principles.</li>
            <li>Deeper understanding of how rumours spread and the factors that can accelerate or suppress that spread —
                like social connections and gullibility.</li>
            <li>Practiced breaking down a complex idea into modular, manageable Java classes and logic.</li>
            <li>Balancing sociology ideas with technical modelling — a challenge I really enjoyed.</li>
        </ul>
