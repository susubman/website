        <h3>
            Motivation.
        </h3>

        <div class="para">
            <p>
                I grew up in Singapore, and the issue of car park availability is something I’ve experienced firsthand.
                With the city’s high population density and government-regulated car ownership, finding a parking space
                can be a challenge, particularly during peak hours.
                This personal connection sparked my interest in using machine learning to predict parking availability.
            </p>

            <p>
                As part of my <b>Master's in Computer Science</b>, I wanted to apply machine learning techniques to
                real-world problems, specifically one that had clear practical implications.
                I decided to focus on predicting car park availability in Housing Development Board (HDB) car parks,
                utilizing not only historical data but also contextual information like weather, public holidays, and
                the outcomes of Certificate of Entitlement (COE) bidding.
            </p>

            <p>
                The goal of the project was to understand how these factors might influence parking demand and whether
                they could improve the accuracy of predictive models.
                This project gave me the opportunity to combine my knowledge of machine learning with a familiar,
                real-world issue that affects many people in Singapore.

            How I Built It.
        </h3>

        <div class="para">
            <p><b>Language used: </b>Python — perfect for machine learning tasks and data manipulation.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>
            Main Components.
        </h4>

        <ul class="list-block">
            <li><code>RF_parking.py</code>: Trains and evaluates Random Forest models to predict the number of lots
                available in the next hour.</li>
            <li><code>LSTM_parking.py</code>: Builds, trains and evalutes LSTM models using Tensorflow/Keras, leveraging
                temporal sequences for evaluation.</li>
            <li><code>dataset.py</code>: Core data preperation script — connects to a PostgreSQL database, handles
                missing values, merges and scales contextual features, generates the target variable for supervised
                learning.</li>
            <li><code>datasets/</code>: Directory containing CSV files and the <b>database schema</b> used to create and
                populate tables in PostgreSQL.</li>
            <li><code>requirements.txt</code>: Specifies Python dependencies such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow,
                and Psycopg.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>
            The Logic.
        </h4>

        <ol class="ordered-list">
            <li><b>Data Processing:</b></li>

            <ul class="list-block">
                <li>Data from Singapore's open data portal was used, including car park lot data, weather forecasts, COE
                    results and public holidays.</li>
                <li>The data was preprocessed by aggregating minut-level car park availability into hourly intervals.
                </li>
                <li>Contextual data like weather conditions, public holidays, and COE bidding results were integrated
                    into the dataset.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><b>Model Development:</b></li>

            <ul class="list-block">
                <li><b>Baseline Model:</b> Trained on historical parking lot data.</li>
                <li><b>Contextual Model:</b> Added external data (weather, public holidays, COE).</li>
                <li>Used Scikit-Learn for Random Forest and TensorFlow for LSTM.</li>
                <li>Tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search Cross Validation</li>
                <li>Evaluated performance with metrics like MAE and RMSE.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><b>Final Models:</b></li>

            <ul class="list-block">
                <li><b>Random Forest:</b> Slightly outperformed LSTM in terms of accuracy and required less
                    computational resources.</li>
                <li><b>LSTM:</b> Good for time-series forecasting but was computationally heavier.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <h3>
            What I Learned.
        </h3>

        <ul class="list-block">
            <li><b>Time-series forecasting:</b> I gained hands-on expereince with LSTM, a model designed specifically
                for sequential data.</li>
            <li><b>Machine learning in pracitce:</b> learnt how to apply different algorithms to different real-world
                datasets and to critically evaluate their perfomance metrics.</li>
            <li><b>Use of a databse:</b> utilised PostgreSQL with many large datasets and managed it in SQL.</li>
